                It is said that if you are planning for a lifetime, educate people. Indeed the quality of education determines the destiny of a nation. Education is not just a process of giving knowledge for a future job, but a lifelong process which creates an understanding of moral and ethical values to guide oneâ€™s life.<br>
                <br>
                <br>

At B.K. Birla College we provide an environment where academic excellence along with co-curricular and extra-curricular activities completes the process of education. I am happy to share that B.K. Birla College is progressing in all its endeavors towards the overall personality development of the students.<br>
<br>
<br>

Success of the college can be attributed to our ability to identify and respond to the changing demands across the highly-rising education sector. We have set ourselves the dual objectives of being recognized as a premier provider of education and carrying on the legacy of this great nation in defining a future even more powerful than our past. Right from its inception to now, our institution has marched forward to spread the light of education and pave the path of academic excellence for every student.<br>

Smt. Neerja ji Birla, our esteemed patron has visited B.K. Birla College on Tuesday, the 28th February, 2017 for Degree Distribution Ceremony. It will remain as a most memorable day. It was indeed a day when we could get inspired by her presence and thought provoking interaction paving the way for furthering the value education system which House of Birlas are known for.<br>
<br>
<br>

We remain committed to realize full potential of our students.<br>
<br>

I take this opportunity to thank one and all for keeping faith in us and wish to place on record my sincere appreciation to my colleagues at the Governing Council, Teaching and Non-teaching faculty of the college and support staff, which worked tirelessly with dedication to achieve this glory.
